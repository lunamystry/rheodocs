Our secure web application allows you to safely and conveniently share
real-time stock information from your existing accounting system with suppliers
and customers.

   - Reduce communication costs by allowing your customers to access product
    availability and price on-line rather than by telephone â€“ even outside
    office hours. 

   - Better delivery performance from suppliers that can now
    follow consumption of their products and anticipate the next order.

   - Increase customer service by monitoring and replenishing customer stock
    levels. 

   - Higher stock turnover and availability from planning stock holding
    based on stock in the entire supply chain.  

   - Fine-grained control over who
    has access to what information on which products.

Access to shared information is free. For companies wishing to share
information we offer a trial period and affordable pricing based on the value
delivered.
